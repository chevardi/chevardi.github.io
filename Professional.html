		<h2> My Vision </h2>
			<p> I often daydream about the potential of Jamaica becoming a massive contributor
			to the international media space. However I believe the only way to do this is to 
			start locally. My vision includes the transformation of the Jamaican media world 
			into a more exuberant, quality filled environment. It is through this that we would be able to 
			raise the eyebrows of our international neighbours, with our stellar
			content creation that would be shared in an arrray of mediums. These would include:
			</p>
					
				<ul>
					<li>sitcoms</li>
					<li>advertisements</li>
					<li>social media content</li>
					<li>live action series & movies</li>
					<li>animated shorts & movies</li>
				</ul>
					
				<p> Through high quality production of the stated above, i truly see
				Jamaica become a giant in content creation; sharing our rich culture with
				the international community. I envision myself playing a key role in this.
				</p>

			<h3>My Mission</h3>
				<p> To use my gifts as a creative to improve the 
				quality of the content that comes out of my beloved nation,
				and reduce the manisfestation of the current stereotypes
				attached to our people. 
				</p>
		<hr>
				<p> It should be noted that these goals are in alignment with my field of study
				as can be further seen by clicking the logo below to view my resume.
