				<h3>Personal Motto</h3>
				<p> "The man who never made a mistake never made anything"</p>
		
				<h3> Likes </h3>
			<p> We all have things that we are fond of or enjoy doing. Here are a few
				of mine:
			</p>
					
				<ul>
					<li>football</li>
					<li>music</li>
					<li>playing the piano</li>
					<li>editing</li>
					<li>story writing</li>
				</ul>
					
				<p> These interests have played a key role in my development over the years,
				which can further be seen in the development tab.
				</p>

			<h3> Dislikes </h3>
				<p> It is easy to tell yourself how much things you dislike until
				you are actually required to list them out! I am a person that is open to new
				experiences, as I try to view everything from both sides of the coin. However there 
				are certain things that can never be truly justified in my opinion, such as heinous crimes.
				Simpler dislikes that I can name include:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>noise</li>
					<li>crowds</li>
					<li>hard work <i>(because who likes that?!)</i></li> 
					
				</ul>

				<br></br>
				
				<p>According to these results, ther possibility of having several
				personality disorders are very possible for me. Though I have not fully
				grasped what some of the terms mean, i believe this is a fair analysis regular
				personality. I say regular because everything depends on the my mood in any particular
				scenario.
