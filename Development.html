			<h3>Twelve Pillars</h3>		
			<p>The novel portrays <mark>Charlie</mark>, a relatively elderly man and <mark>Michael</mark> as the two main characters. Charlie and Michael 
			develop a <strong>strong</strong> mentor-student relationship, which Charlie uses as a vehicle to pass on his knowledge to a younger 
			Michael; who one may say, has a lot to learn. Charlie lays out the fundamentals of <u>self development</u> to Michael, and 
			challenges him to heed to his words. Throughout the four chapters Charlie highlights four major developmental topics, 
			which he hopes Michael will use as keys to unlock the next stage of his life. They are as follows:  Achieve your goals, 
			the proper use of time, surround yourself with the best people and be a life long learner.
			</p>
			
			<p>Twelve Pillars is a great novel, in which the writers did a great job of teaching life lessons. The book really 
			enabled me to ponder on my own life, and inspired me to apply what I have read to it. In the pursuit of greatness, 
			these are the things that one needs to think about. However, no one is saying it will be easy, but the first step beginning. 
			After a few weeks of discipline, it will become a way of life and I will find myself a new man with a different outlook on life. 
			This book has already begun to play a role in my self development, and I am glad for the opportunity that this module has given  
			me to be exposed to it.</p>
